# VoidOS

This is a pet project focusing on improving the "xv6" OS, more specifically the x86_64 version.
I am just doing my best, and it's just a pet project, after all! It's primarily written in C with
Assembly elements included!

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ElisStaaf/voidos
cd voidos
make
make qemu
```
